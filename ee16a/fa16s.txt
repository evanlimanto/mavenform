Section 1 (18 points)

Unless told otherwise, you must show work to get credit. There will be very little partial credit given in this
section.

3. True/False (6 points, 1 point for each question)

Answer each of the following questions by circling True or False. No work is necessary for credit on this
part.

(a) (True) (False) The pivot columns of matrix A forms a basis for the column space of A.
(b) (True) (False) Let A be a 2× 2 matrix, where A2 = 0. Then A is the zero matrix.
(c) (True) (False) Let A,B,C be some arbitrary matrices. Then, (AB)C = A(BC).
(d) (True) (False) An M × N matrix has at most N pivots.
(e) (True) (False) AB = BA where A and B are N × N matrices.
(f) (True) (False) Applying any pair of 2× 2 rotation matrices to an input vector is a commutative opera-

tion.

4. Proof (7 points)

(a) Prove that if A(cid:126)x = 0 for some nonzero (cid:126)x, then the columns of A are linearly dependent.

(b) Prove that if A2 = 0 where A is an arbitrary square matrix, then the columns of A are linearly dependent.

6. Directional Shovels (10 points)

Kody and Nara were found exceptional at taking measurements to ﬁgure out light intensities, and they were
both granted admission to a graduate school. Unfortunately, they both supported their new school’s football
team while they were playing against Berkeley and angry Berkeley fans found them and left them in a room
at an unknown location under the ground. As compassionate people, Berkeley fans left some tools in the
room that can help them escape.

(a) Kody found a shovel in the room and ﬁgured that it can operate in the following directions:

}. Is it possible for them to escape to Berkeley by digging in the given directions to a
? If so, ﬁnd the scalars that multiply

7. Graph Majors (30 points)

We’d like to understand how engineering undergrads change their majors. For simplicity, there are three
majors we’ll look at: EECS, CS, and MechE. Let’s assume that students can only be studying one major at
a time, and must be studying one of these three majors. Let’s also assume that once a week, students can
choose to switch to another major, or stick with what they’re studying. So, a discrete time step represents
one week.

words, the total number of students is conserved. Write a system of four linear equations that relate k1,

8. Transformation Basketball (15 points)

Kevin Bancroft just joined the Column Space Warriors. In order to better learn how to cooperate with the
team before the season starts, he and his teammates are practicing some basketball drills.

(a) Kevin Bancroft and Draymond Blue-Gold are running a drill where they each have to run from a
starting coordinate to an end coordinate. Kevin starts at point ks = [3 7]T and wants to go to point
ke = [−4 10]T . Draymond starts at point ds = [−6 1]T and wants to go to point de = [−7 − 5]T .

Each player must apply the same matrix transformation A on his starting point to reach reach his end
point, such that Aks = ke and Ads = de. Derive the transformation matrix A, if possible. We also know
that the transformation matrix A is of the form A =

(c) After a couple of drills, Kevin Bancroft came up with a new idea – he decided to race his teammates
across the court to see who is faster. Kevin starts at point ks = [−2 1]T and ends at ke = [3 2]T . Steph
starts at ss = [0 0]T and ends at se = [−6 − 3]T . Can this be represented by a transformation matrix?
Brieﬂy justify why or why not.
