Solutions: The matrix is upper triangular, so the matrix’s columns must be linearly independent and
there is enough information to determine exactly how many enemy imps there are at each campsite.
We can ﬁnd the number of imps at each campsite by row reducing the following augmented system:

Thus, we discover that:
• Camp A has 5 imps
• Camp B has 0 imps
• Camp C has 2 imps
• Camp D has 3 imps

We can check our answer by substituting our answers into the original equations:

1· 5 + 5· 0 + 1· 2 = 5 + 2 = 7
2· 0 + 4· 2 + 6· 3 = 8 + 18 = 26

(c) Oh no! You just found out that the evil imps manipulated the faerie lights from Group 1, rendering
their information useless. You send in an emergency group of faeries to make up for the loss. They
gained a total of 10 brightness units, and visited camps as follows:

• 1 faerie light visited Camp B
• 2 faerie lights visited Camp C
• 3 faerie lights visited Camp D

From this information (together with the information from Groups 2, 3, 4), can you determine how
many imps are at each campsite? If so, report their numbers to help the faeries! If not, explain why
not.
Solutions: No you cannot determine how many imps are at each campsite.

• The new team does not pass through Camp A so you have no way of determining the number of

imps in Camp A.

• The new measurement conﬂicts with an existing measurement. The system of equations is incon-

sistent, so there is no solution.

• The new measurement is a linearly dependent one. Speciﬁcally, it sends half the faerie lights
that the second measurement sends. Therefore, we do not have enough linearly independent
measurements to solve for the imps in each camp.

7. A Tale of a Million Technocrats and the Four Dream Cities (24 Points)

This problem is a tale of one million Technocrats and four Dream Cities. Listed in order from West to East,
the four cities are (I) San Francisco, (II) Denver, (III) Chicago, and (IV) New York City.
The Technocrats don’t die. They don’t reproduce. In other words, their total population size is a constant
from the initial time n = 0 to the end of time as n → ∞. At the strike of each second on a Universal Clock,
each Technocrat chooses to either remain at the city he or she is already in, or move instantaneously to
another of the four Dream Cities, according to the following rules:

• Every Technocrat who moves to either San Francisco or New York City will stay in that city forever

(no more moving thereafter!);

• Whether eastward or westward, every Technocrat moves in single hops—so for example, no direct

move from San Francisco to either Chicago or New York City is allowed;

• At each second, the fraction of Technocrats in each city who move eastward legally (e.g. from Denver

to Chicago, or from Chicago to New York City) is β ;

• At each second, the fraction of Technocrats in each city who move westward legally (e.g. from Chicago

to Denver, or from Denver to San Francisco) is α;
• The following inequality must be true: α + β ≤ 1.

The following diagram summarizes these restrictions graphically.

(cid:126)s[n] = A−1(cid:126)s[n + 1].

Consider a model of the Technocrat migration system described above with β = α = 1/3. Assume

Rows 2 and 3 are identical, so A1 is not invertible. In other words, the row vectors are linearly depen-

8. Ayy - Reﬂections on SIXTEEN (28 points)

(cid:21)

(cid:20)px

You are involved in the design of a robot called SIXTEEN-AYY that has arms with a certain range of motion
and certain operations that the arms can perform.
For parts (a)–(e) of this problem, we will look at a simpliﬁed case where we pretend that the robot’s arm can
move only in a 2-dimensional space. Thus, we will represent the position of the end of the robot’s arm with
a vector (cid:126)p =
. Let’s further assume that the robot will be built to perform two movement commands
determined by the following transformations:
T1: Reﬂects (cid:126)p about the line y = −x.
T2: Rotates (cid:126)p clockwise about the origin by 45◦

(e) If SIXTEEN-AYY started out in the same initial conﬁguration for both Bob and Leah, will its arm
end up in the same place after executing Leah’s command as it does after executing Bob’s command?
Brieﬂy justify why or why not.
Solutions: No, the resulting matrices won’t be the same because we’ve just shown A1A2 (cid:54)= A2A1; i.e.
matrix multiplication is not commutative.

(g) Finally, we’d like to allow the robot to place the end of its arm at a point that is θ radians above the x-y
plane, but as shown below, is still restricted to a two-dimensional plane at that angle. Write the basis
vectors that would correspond to this possible range of motion for a ﬁxed θ.
(Hint: If you had a point along the y- axis and wanted to rotate it by an angle of θ radians relative to
the y-axis while remaining on the y-z plane, what transformation would you apply?)

Solutions: We notice that a rotation relative to the y-axis maintains the same x-value while rotating
our y and z by θ radians. Thus, we can write the transformation matrix as

Note that since we only had two basis vectors to begin with, the new range of motion also only needs
two basis vectors corresponding to the rotation of the x and y unit vectors, so our basis vectors are:

9. Goodness Gracious, Great Balls of Fur! (28 points)

You are a biologist who has discovered a new species of rodents that live in tunnels underground, and you
have named the species "furballs". You have been observing a particular network of tunnels. Figure 1 shows
the network of tunnels with three chambers in it. To document their behavior, you observe the number of
furballs in each chamber at every minute. After observing the furballs’ behavior for a while, you have ﬁg-
ured out that their behavior follows a regular pattern. Each minute, a well deﬁned fraction of the furballs
in a given chamber move to the other chambers. The fractions you have observed are shown in Figure 1.
The fractions of furballs leaving the Play Room could not be determined through your observations, and are
shown as the variables p1, p2, and p3

Figure 1

(a) Let the number of furballs in the Food Storeroom at time n be x f [n], the number of furballs in Sleep
room at time n be xs[n], and the number of furballs in the Play Room at time n be xp[n]. We would like

from a particular room, and each row corresponds to the incoming arrows to a particular room:

(b) We know that no furballs enter or leave the conﬁguration of tunnels shown above and that during the
time you’re observing the behavior, and no furballs die or are born. What constraint does this place on
the values of p1, p2, p3? Write your answer in equation form.

Solutions: If number is conserved, this means each column vector in the matrix sums to 1. Therefore:

Solutions:
(i) The third row in Ai consists of all zeros. This means, at any positive timestep, (cid:126)x would be forced to
have zero as its third entry. Therefore, the given (cid:126)x[2] is not in the range of this matrix, and this option
do not represent a possible set of behaviors.

(ii) The ﬁrst two rows in Aii are the same. This means, at any positive timestep, (cid:126)x would be forced to
have the same number in its ﬁrst and second entry. Therefore, the given (cid:126)x[2] is not in the range of this
matrix, and this option do not represent a possible set of behaviors.

(iii) The given (cid:126)x[2] is in the range of Aiii. Therefore, full credit was given for choosing this option.
However, number is not conserved in this option. Since it was ambiguous whether or not number
was meant to be conserved in the question, partial credit was given for excluding this option with this
explanation.
