b)  (4  pts)  Now  let’s  say  we  set  up  a  vector 
T ,  where 
xberkeley(i) represents the number of people living in Berkeley at month i (similarly 
for Boston and xboston(i) ).  Write a matrix Atransition that you could multiply by this 
vector  to  predict  the  number  of  people  living  in  each  city  at  month  i+1  (i.e., 
(

c)  (9 pts) Now let us say the total population stays constant, and we start with half 
the population in Berkeley and the other half in Boston. Use the matrix you wrote 
above  to  find  the  steady-state  populations  in  Berkeley  and  Boston.  If  the  total 
population is 100, calculate the number of people in Berkeley at steady state?
