Answer each of the following questions by circling True or False. No work is necessary for credit on this
part.

(a) (True) (False) The pivot columns of matrix A forms a basis for the column space of A.
(b) (True) (False) Let A be a 2× 2 matrix, where A2 = 0. Then A is the zero matrix.
(c) (True) (False) Let A,B,C be some arbitrary matrices. Then, (AB)C = A(BC).
(d) (True) (False) An M × N matrix has at most N pivots.
(e) (True) (False) AB = BA where A and B are N × N matrices.
(f) (True) (False) Applying any pair of 2× 2 rotation matrices to an input vector is a commutative operation.
