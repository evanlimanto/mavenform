<b>7. Finding the bright cave (27pts total)</b><br/>

Nara the one-handed druid and Kody the one-handed ranger ﬁnd themselves in dire straits. Before them is a cliff with four cave entrances arranged in a square: two upper caves and two lower caves. Each entrance emits a certain amount of light, and the two wish to ﬁnd exactly the amount of light coming from each cave. Here’s the catch: after contracting a particularly potent strain of ghoul fever, our intrepid heroes are only able to see the total intensity of light before them (so their eyes operate like a single-pixel camera). Kody and Nara are capable adventurers. But they don’t know any linear algebra - and they need your help. <br/><br/>

Kody proposes an imaging strategy where he uses his hand to completely block the light from two caves at a time. He is able to take measurements using the following four masks (black means the light is blocked from that cave):

$$
\text{Cave Labels} \\
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
x_1 & x_2 \\ \hline
x_3 & x_4 \\ \hline
\end{array}

\begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
 &  \\ \hline
 &  \\ \hline
\end{array}
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
 &  \\ \hline
 &  \\ \hline
\end{array}
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
 &  \\ \hline
 &  \\ \hline
\end{array}
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
 &  \\ \hline
 &  \\ \hline
\end{array}
$$

<p align="center">Figure 1: Four image masks.</p>

(a) <b>(5pts)</b> Let $\vec{x}$ be the four-element vector that represents the magnitude of light emanating from the four cave entrances. <b>Write a matrix $K$ that performs the masking process in Fig. 1 on the vector $\vec{x}$, such that $K\vec{x}$ is the result of the four measurements.</b><br/></br>

(b) <b>(10pts)</b> Does Kody’s set of masks give us a unique solution for all four caves’ light intensities? Why or why not?<br/><br/>

(c) <b>(12pts)</b> Nara, in her inﬁnite wisdom, places her one hand diagonally across the entrances, covering two of the cave entrances. However her hand is not wide enough, letting in 50% of the light from the caves covered and 100% of the light from the caves not covered. The following diagram shows the percentage of light let through from each cave:<br/><br/>

$$
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
50\% & 100\% \\ \hline
100\% & 50\% \\ \hline
\end{array}
$$

<b>Does this additional measurement give them enough information to solve the problem? Why or
why not?</b>
