Section 1: Straightforward questions (24 points)

Unless told otherwise, you must show work to get credit. There will be very little partial credit given in this
section. You get one drop: do 3 out of the following 4 questions. (We will grade all 4 and keep the best
3 scores.) Each problem is worth 8 points. Students who get all 4 questions correct will receive some bonus
points (6 points).
