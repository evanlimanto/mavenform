(b) Assume that from one week to the next, no students drop out or are enrolled to the system – in other
words, the total number of students is conserved. Write a system of four linear equations that relate k1,
k2, k3, k4. Hint: you should use xe[n], xc[n], xm[n], xe[n + 1], xc[n + 1], xm[n + 1] in your answer.

8. Transformation Basketball (15 points)

Kevin Bancroft just joined the Column Space Warriors. In order to better learn how to cooperate with the
team before the season starts, he and his teammates are practicing some basketball drills.

(a) Kevin Bancroft and Draymond Blue-Gold are running a drill where they each have to run from a
starting coordinate to an end coordinate. Kevin starts at point ks = [3 7]T and wants to go to point
ke = [−4 10]T . Draymond starts at point ds = [−6 1]T and wants to go to point de = [−7 − 5]T .

Each player must apply the same matrix transformation A on his starting point to reach reach his end
point, such that Aks = ke and Ads = de. Derive the transformation matrix A, if possible. We also know
that the transformation matrix A is of the form A =

, where a,b are real numbers.

(c) After a couple of drills, Kevin Bancroft came up with a new idea – he decided to race his teammates
across the court to see who is faster. Kevin starts at point ks = [−2 1]T and ends at ke = [3 2]T . Steph
starts at ss = [0 0]T and ends at se = [−6 − 3]T . Can this be represented by a transformation matrix?
Brieﬂy justify why or why not.
