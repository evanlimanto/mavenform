q8_1: |
  Environmental scientists use the octanol-water partition coefficient, KOW, to predict where a compound will remain if released into the environment. If a chemical is more soluble in the octanol, it tends to accumulate in the tissues of animals. If the chemical is more soluble in water, it tends to be easily flushed as waste by the animals. The equilibrium constant expresses the relative amounts dissolved in the two solvents.

  ## FLOWER COLOR AND SOIL
  The acidity of soil is thought to play an important role in determining the color of the flowers on certain plants. Gardeners control the acid base properties of the soil by the addition of metal salts, such as aluminum compounds.

  |Name|Formula|$K_{sp}$|solubility|
  |----|-------|--------|----------|
  |Aluminum hydroxide|$Al(OH)_3$|$4.6 * 10^{-33}$|$3.4 * 10^{-9}$ M|
  |Aluminum phosphate|$Al(PO)_4$|$6.3 * 10^{-19}$|$7.8 * 10^{-10}$ M|

  <hr class="s2" />
  Which aluminum compound is the least soluble?

q14_1_i:
  - Aluminum hydroxide, $Al(OH)_3$
  - Aluminum phosphate, $Al(PO_4)$
  - Aluminum sulfate, $Al_2(SO_4)_3$

q14_1_s: 2

q15_1: |
  Why does aluminum hydroxide, $Al\(OH\)\_3$, have a smaller $K\_{sp}$, but a larger solubility compared with aluminum phosphate, $Al\(PO\_4\)$?

q15_1_i:
  - Aluminum hydroxide, $Al(OH)_3$, is a strong base, and therefore, it dissociates completely. So it is more soluble.
  - The relationship between solubility and Ksp is different for the two salts because of the different charges on the anions.
  - Phosphate, $PO\_4^{3\-}$, is a weak base, and therefore, forms a buffer. The $PO\_4^{3\-}$ equilibrates with $HPO\_4^{2\-}$, thereby decreasing it solubility.
