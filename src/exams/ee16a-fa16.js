<h3>3. True/False (6 points, 1 point for each question)</h3>

Answer each of the following questions by circling True or False. No work is necessary for credit on this
part.<br/>

(a) (True) (False) The pivot columns of matrix \(A\) forms a basis for the column space of \(A\).<br/>
(b) (True) (False) Let \(A\) be a \(2 × 2\) matrix, where \(A^2\) = 0. Then \(A\) is the zero matrix.<br/>
(c) (True) (False) Let \(A\), \(B\), \(C\) be some arbitrary matrices. Then, \((AB)C\) = \(A(BC)\).<br/>
(d) (True) (False) An \(M × N\) matrix has at most \(N\) pivots.<br/>
(e) (True) (False) \(AB\) = \(BA\) where \(A\) and \(B\) are \(N × N\) matrices.<br/>
(f) (True) (False) Applying any pair of \(2 × 2\) rotation matrices to an input vector is a commutative operation.<br/>

<h3>4. Proof (7 points)</h3>

(a) Prove that if \(A\\vec{x}\) = 0 for some nonzero (cid:126)x, then the columns of A are linearly dependent. <br/>
(b) Prove that if A2 = 0 where A is an arbitrary square matrix, then the columns of A are linearly dependent.
