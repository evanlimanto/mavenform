  The solution to the NMR question of both exams is quite simple:
  <hr class="s1" />
  The formula indicates the presence of one ring or one double bond: all 10 hydrogens can be seen as two CH3 and three CH2 groups; these five groups account for five of thesix carbons and all of the hydrogens leaving CO; cannot be an alcohol as no OH; cannot be an ehter as there are no H on carbon bearing O; thus, the O must be a ketone (C=O) and thus there is a double bond but no ring. Thus, you must put together CH3 CH3 CH2 CH2 CH2 C=O so as to account for the splitting; as there is no methyne carbon, there is no branching and all six carbons form a straight chain; the O cannot be on the end of the chain (that would be an aldehyde which would show a single proton); thus, the carbonyl group must be on the 2nd or 3rd carbon of the chain; on the 3rd carbon there are two CH3CH2 groups; on the 2nd carbon there is only one.

  10\. Provide reagents that could be used to convert the starting material shown below to the indicated product. If a reaction requires a second step (e.g., the addition of water to provide a proton for the product) then use two arrows.
