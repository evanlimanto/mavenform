  <strong>6. Wall Shadows (15 points)</strong><hr class=”s1” />
  Oh no, someone decided to build a wall between you and your 
  favorite neighbor! They built a huge complicated
  3D structure that you cannot fully see. However, you can observe 
  the shadow cast by this structure.<hr class="s2" />
  (a) (5 points) Let’s first try to model what the shadow of a 3D 
  object might be. Create a transformation that flattens all 
  components of a vector (vectors in 3D space) onto the xy-plane. 
  That is, find a matrix A such that :<p align="center"><img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/studyform-staging/ucberkeley/img/EE16A/mt1-sp17-q6-1.png"></p>

q6_2: |
  (b) (5 points) Suppose you wanted to observe the height of the 
  wall. Could you observe it just by seeing the shadow, assuming the 
  shadow is created by the transformation from the matrix above?<hr class="s2" />

q6_3: |
  (c) (5 points) One of your friends comes along and wonders, if you 
  apply the matrix again, whether you will get any new information. 
  Realizing your matrix is really just a projection, you argue that 
  projecting twice will give you no new information. We will show this 
  generally for any two vectors. To prove this to your friend, show the following:

  <strong>7. Structured Illumination (20 points)</strong>
  In the lab, you acquired images using a single pixel imager and a 
  projector. You did this by successively creating different 
  illumination patterns (masks) and recording the total intensity at 
  the single pixel detector. In this problem, consider a 3×3 
  illumination grid, where we will use structured light patterns (not 
  justsingle-pixel masks) to acquire image information.<hr class="s2" />
  The 9 pixels, represented by<img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/studyform-staging/ucberkeley/img/EE16A/mt1-sp17-q7-1.png">have values that are either 
  0 (no light reflected by the object at that pixel location) or 1 (light is 
  completely reflected by object at that pixel location). For example, 
  if you use your sensor to look at the Campanile, pixels<hr class="s2" /><img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/studyform-staging/ucberkeley/img/EE16A/mt1-sp17-q7-2.png">would reflect light from an illumination source, or for
  Cory Hall, the bottom two rows would reflect light, as shown in Fig. ??
  <img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/studyform-staging/ucberkeley/img/EE16A/mt1-sp17-q7-3.png"><p align="center">Figure 1: Campus objects represented with 9 pixels</p> 
  For this problem, we will try to use just two mask patterns to 
  recognize various objects around campus usingour sensor.<hr class="s2" />
  (a) (2 points) For this part, consider the mask patterns shown in Fig. ??.
  <hr class="s2" /><img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/studyform-staging/ucberkeley/img/EE16A/mt1-sp17-q7-4.png"><p align="center">Figure 2: Two scanning patterns</p> 
  The value detected at our light sensor for a particular mask pattern 
  is the dot-product of the mask pattern with the 9-pixel 
  representation of the object. Using the two mask patterns in Fig. <strong>2</strong>, write down a matrix <strong>K</strong> to transform some image 
  represented by a 9-element vector,<img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/studyform-staging/ucberkeley/img/EE16A/mt1-sp17-q7-5.png"> into a 2-element
  vector,<img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/studyform-staging/ucberkeley/img/EE16A/mt1-sp17-q7-6.png"><hr class="s2" />

q7_2: |
  (b) (2 points) The objects we will image first are 9-pixel 
  representations of the Campanile and Cory Hall,shown in Fig. 
  <strong>??.</strong> Write down two vectors,<img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/studyform-staging/ucberkeley/img/EE16A/mt1-sp17-q7-7.png">that represent the 
  image data shown in Fig. ??, using 0 for dark pixels and 1 for light pixels.<hr class="s2" />

  (c) (2 points) Use the K matrix from part a) to transform<img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/studyform-staging/ucberkeley/img/EE16A/mt1-sp17-q7-8.png">into 2-element vectors,<img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/studyform-staging/ucberkeley/img/EE16A/mt1-sp17-q7-9.png"><hr class="s2" />

  (d) (4 points) Based on your results in part c), how would you use 
  the elements of your output vector ~y to distinguish between the 
  Campanile and Cory Hall?

q7_5: |
  (e) (2 points) Now, let’s consider using this method to look at other 
  objects, like Sather Gate (arch-shaped) and the Greek Theater 
  (bowl-shaped), which are represented in Fig. <strong>??.</strong>

  (f) (4 points) Can you use the outputs you computed in the 
  previous part,<img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/studyform-staging/ucberkeley/img/EE16A/mt1-sp17-q7-14.png">to distinguish between Sather Gate and 
  the Greek Theater? Why or why not?

  (g) (2 points) The difference between the Sather and Greek objects are the pixels <img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/studyform-staging/ucberkeley/img/EE16A/mt1-sp17-q7-15.png">When we generate the vector<img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/studyform-staging/ucberkeley/img/EE16A/mt1-sp17-q7-16.png">the 5th and 8th elements of<img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/studyform-staging/ucberkeley/img/EE16A/mt1-sp17-q7-17.png">select the 5th or 8th column of K. In terms of linear independence, what is the relationship between the 5th and 8th column of <strong>K?</strong>

q7_8: |
  (h) (2 points) You want to be able to distinguish all four objects with 
  just two mask patterns, so you try one more thing: turning your 
  illumination source 90◦clockwise. This makes the new mask 
  patterns shown in Fig. <strong>??.</strong>

  # 8. Reservoirs That Give and Take (15 points)
  Consider a network of three water reservoirs A, B, and C. At the 
  end of each day water transfers among the reservoirs according to 
  the directed graph shown below.
  <p align="center"><img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/studyform-staging/ucberkeley/img/EE16A/mt1-sp17-q8-1.png"></p>
  The parameters a, b, and c—which label the self-loops—denote the 
  fractions of the water in reservoirs A,B, and C, respectively, that 
  stay in the same reservoir at the end of each day n. The parameters 
  d, e, and f denote the fractions of the reservoir contents that 
  transfer to adjacent reservoirs at the end of each day,
  according to the directed graph above.<hr class="s2" />
  Assume that the reservoir system is conservative—no water enters 
  or leaves the system, which means that the total water in the 
  network is constant. Accordingly, for each node, the weights on its 
  self-loop and its two outgoing edges sum to 1; for example, for 
  Node A, we have<hr class="s2" /><p align="center">a+d + f = 1,</p>
  and similar equations hold for the other nodes. Moreover, assume 
  that all the edge weights are positive numbers—that is,<p align="center">0 &lt; a,b, c,d, e, f &lt; 1.</p> 
  The state evolution equation governing the water flow dynamics in 
  the reservoir system is given by s[n+1] =As[n], where the 3×3 
  matrix A is the state transition matrix, and <img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/studyform-staging/ucberkeley/img/EE16A/mt1-sp17-q8-2.png"> is the
  nonnegative state vector that shows the water distribution among 
  the three reservoirs at the end of Day n, as fractions of the total 
  water in the network.<hr class=”s1” />
  In particular,<img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/studyform-staging/ucberkeley/img/EE16A/mt1-sp17-q8-3.png">where the symbol <img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/studyform-staging/ucberkeley/img/EE16A/mt1-sp17-q8-4.png"> denotes 
  componentwise inequality. Since the state vector represents the 
  fractional distribution of water in the network, we have

  (b) (5 points) Determine <img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/studyform-staging/ucberkeley/img/EE16A/mt1-sp17-q8-6.png"> equilibrium state—that is, a 
  state for which the following is true :<p align="center"><img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/studyform-staging/ucberkeley/img/EE16A/mt1-sp17-q8-7.png"> </p><hr class="s2" />

  (c) (5 points) Suppose the state transition matrix for the network is 
  given by<p align="center"><img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/studyform-staging/ucberkeley/img/EE16A/mt1-sp17-q8-8.png"> </p>
  Is it possible to determine the state s[n] from the subsequent state 
  s[n + 1]? Provide a reasonably concise, yet clear and convincing 
  explanation to justify your answer. You’re NOT asked to compute
  s[n] from s[n+1] explicitly, but rather to assert, with justification, 
  whether it is possible to do so.

  (c) (5 points) Show that a state transition matrix representing a 
  conservative system will always have the eigenvalue <img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/studyform-staging/ucberkeley/img/EE16A/mt1-sp17-q9-3.png"> 
  Recall that all columns of a conservative state transition matrix sum to one.
