  1\. (5 points) For what value of $a$ is the fucntion
  $$f(x) = \begin{cases} x^2 & x \lt 3 \\\\ 2ax & x \ge 3$$
  continuous at every $x$? As always, justify your answer.

  2\. (5 points) The theory of relativity predicts that an object whose mass is $m_0$ when it is at rest will appear heavier when it is moving at speeds near the speed of light. When the object is moving at speed $v$, its mass $m$ is given by
  $$m = \frac{m_0}{\sqrt{1 - (v^2/c^2)}}$$
  where $c$ is the speed of light. Find $\frac{dm}{dv}$ and explain in terms of physics what this quantity tells you.

  9. (5 points) A balloon ascending at a rate of $12 \; ft/s$ is at a height of $80 \; ft$ above the ground when a package is dropped. How long does it take the package to reach the ground? (Hint: the acceleration due to gravity is $32 \; ft/s^2$ downward. Use antiderivatives.) You may leave your answer in radical form.
