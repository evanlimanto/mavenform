q1_1: |
  The volume of an expanding cloud of gas starts at $10$ L and multiplies by some factor $m$ each second.
  <hr class="s1" />
  (a) In terms of $m$ and number of elapsed seconds $t$, write down an expression for the volume of the gas after $t$ seconds.

q1_1_s: |
  $10m^t$ L

q1_2: |
  (b) If, after $100$ seconds, the cloud of gas has doubled in size, what is $m$? No need to simplify your answer.

q1_2_s: |
  $10m^{100} = 2 \cdot 10 \implies m^{100} = 2 \implies m = 2^{1/100}$

q1_3: |
  (c) How long until the gas reaches $50$ L?

q1_3_s: |
  $10m^t = 50 \implies m^t = 5$
  <hr class="s1" />
  $(2^{1/100})^t = 5 \implies 2^{t/100} = 5$
  <hr class="s1" />
  $\frac{t}{100}\ln(2) = \ln(5)$
  <hr class="s1" />
  $t = \frac{100 \ln(5)}{\ln(2)}$ seconds after start

q1_4: |
  (d) Let $V(t)$ denote the volume as a function of time. What is the instantaneous rate of change of $V(t)$ at $t = 0$?

q1_4_s: |
  $v(t) = 10m^t = 10 \cdot 2^{1/100}$
  <hr class="s1" />
  $\frac{dV}{dt} = 10 \cdot 2^{t/100} \cdot \frac{1}{100} = \ln(2)$
  <hr class="s1" />
  $\frac{dV}{dt} |_{t=0} = \frac{\ln 2}{10}$

q2_1: |
  Differentiate $f(x) = \frac{1}{1 + x^2}$.

q2_1_s: |
  $f'(x) = \frac{-2x}{(1 + x^2)^2}$

q2_2: |
  Differentiate $f(x) = \sqrt{\sqrt{x}}$.

q2_2_s: |
  $f(x) = \sqrt[4]{x} \implies f'(x) = \frac{1}{4}x^{-3/4}$

q2_3: |
  Differentiate $f(x) = \cos^2 \left( \frac{x^2}{2} \right)$.

q2_3_s: |
  $f'(x) = 2\cos(\frac{x^2}{2}) (-\sin(\frac{x^2}{2})) (x) = -2x \cos(\frac{x^2}{2})\sin(\frac{x^2}{2})$

q2_4: |
  Differentiate $\ln(1 + \sqrt{x})$.

q2_4_s: |
  $f'(x) = \frac{1}{1 + \sqrt{x}} \cdot \frac{1}{2}x^{-1/2} = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{x} + x}$

q3_1: |
  A hyperbola has an equation given by
  $$\frac{x^2}{4} - \frac{y^2}{9} = 1$$
  What is the equation to the tangent line to the hyperbola at $(2\sqrt{2}, 3)$?

q3_1_s: |
  Differentiating implicitly, $\frac{2x}{4} - \frac{2y}{9} \frac{dy}{dx} = 0$ at $(2\sqrt{2}, 3)$ this gives $\sqrt{2} - \frac{2}{3} \frac{dy}{dx} = 0$
  <hr class="s1" />
  Hence $\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2}$ and the equation of the tangent line is $y - 3 = \frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2}(x - 2\sqrt{2})$.

q4_1: |
  $\sqrt[3]{2}$ is close to $\frac{5}{4}$. Use one iteration of Newton's method to improve on this guess.

q4_1_s: |
  Apply Newton's method to $f(x) = x^3 - 2$ with guess $x_1 = \frac{5}{4}$.
  <hr class="s1" />
  $x_2 = x_1 - \frac{(x_1)^3 - 2}{3(x_1)^2} = \frac{63}{50}$

q5_1: |
  What is the 3rd degree Taylor polynomial of $\sin(x)$ centered at $x = 0$? Use your answer to esimate $\sin(\frac{1}{4})$.

q5_1_s: |
  $f(x) = \sin(x) \quad f(0) = 0$
  <hr class="s1" />
  $f'(x) = \cos(x) \quad f'(0) = 1$
  <hr class="s1" />
  $f''(x) = -\sin(x) \quad f''(0) = 0$
  <hr class="s1" />
  $f'''(x) = -\cos(x) \quad f'''(0) = -1$
  <hr class="s2" />
  $T_3(x) = 0 + \frac{1}{1!}(x - 0) + \frac{0}{2!}(x - 0)^2 + \frac{-1}{3!}(x - 0)^3 = x - \frac{x^3}{6}$
  <hr class="s2" />
  $\sin(\frac{1}{4}) \approx \frac{1}{4} - \frac{(\frac{1}{4})^3}{6} = \frac{95}{384}$
