  Evaluate the Riemann sum for $f(x) = 3 - \frac{1}{2}x, 2 \le x \le 14$, with six subintervals, taking the sample points to be left end-points. Explain, with the aid of a diagram, what the Riemann sum represents.

q1_1_s: |
  We have $\sum_{i=1}^{6} f(x_i) \Delta x$ where $\Delta x = \frac{14 - 2}{6} = 2$ and $x_i$ denote the left endpoint of the $i^{th}$ subinterval.
  <hr class="s1" />
  The subintervals are $[2, 4], [4, 6], [6, 8], [8, 10], [10, 12]$, and the left endpoints are $2, 4, 6, 8, 10$.
  <hr class="s1" />
  We have
  $\begin{align}
  \sum_{i=1}^{6} f(x_i) \Delta x &= f(2) \Delta x + f(4) \Delta x + f(6) + \Delta x + f(8) \Delta + f(10) \Delta + f(12) \Delta \\\\
  &= 2 \cdot 2 + 1 \cdot 2 + 0 \cdot 2 + (-1)2 + (-2)2 + (-3)2 \\\\
  &= -6
  \end{align}$

  Consider the illustration below.

  The Riemann sum represents the sum of the areas of the shaded rectangles where the rectangles above the $x$-axis contribute positive area and the rectangles below the $x$-axis contribute negative area.
  <hr class="s1" />
  Note that there is no rectangle over the interval $[6, 8]$ because $f(6) = 0$.
  <hr class="s1" />
  So the Riemann sum is an approximation to the net area between the graph of $f$ and the $x$-axis where area above the $x$-axis counts as positive area and area below the $x$-axis counts as negative area.

  (a) Find the Riemann sum for $f(x) = \sin x, 0 \le x \le 3 \pi / 2$, with six terms, taking the sample points to be right end-points. (Give your answer correct to six decimal places). Explain what the Riemann sum represents with the aid of a sketch.
