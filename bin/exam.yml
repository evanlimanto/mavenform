q1_3_s: |
  $f'(A) = 2(A - 1) + 2(A - 2) + 2(A - 4) = 6A - 14 = 0 \implies A = \frac{7}{3}$

  Find the critical points of
  $$f(x, y) = x^2 + 3y - \ln y \qquad (y > 0)$$
  and classify them as relative maxima, minima or saddle points.

q2_1_s: |
  $\frac{\partial f}{\partial x} = 2x = 0 \implies x = 0 \\\\
  \frac{\partial f}{\partial y} = 3 - \frac{1}{y} = 0 \implies \frac{1}{y} = 3, y = \frac{1}{3} \\\\
  \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x^2} = 2, \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x \partial y} = 0, \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial y^2} = \frac{1}{y^2} = \frac{1}{(1/3)^2} = 9 \\\\
  D = (2)(9) - 0^2 = 18 > 0, \frac{\partial ^2 f}{\partial x^2} = 2 > 0$

q3_1: |
  Use the method of Lagrange multipliers to find the minimum value of
  $$f(x, y, z) = 2x + e^y + z^2$$
  subject to the constraint $x + y + z = 2$. Don't forget to evaluate (and simplify) $f$ at the end.

q3_1_s: |
  $F(x, y, z, \lambda) = 2x + e^y + z^2 + \lambda(x + y + z - 2) \\\\
  \frac{\partial F}{\partial x} = 2 + \lambda = 0 \implies \lambda = -2 \\\\
  \frac{\partial F}{\partial y} = e^y + \lambda = 0 \implies e^y = 2, y = \ln 2 \\\\
  \frac{\partial F}{\partial z} = 2z + \lambda = 0 \implies 2z = 2, z = 1 \\\\
  \frac{\partial F}{\partial \lambda} = x + y + z - 2 = 0 \implies x = 2 - y - z = 2 - \ln 2 - 1 = 1 - \ln 2 \\\\
  f(x, y, z) = 2(1 - \ln 2) + e^{\ln 2} + 1^2 = 5 - 2 \ln 2$

  Evaluate the integral over the region.
  <hr class="s1" />
  $\int \int_R \sqrt{xy} dx \; dy \quad (R = \\{ (x, y) : x \ge 0, y \ge \sqrt{x}, y \le 1 \\})$

  $\begin{align}
  V &= \int_0^1 \int_0^{y^2} x^{1/2} y^{1/2} dx \; dy \\\\
  &= \int_0^1 \left[ \frac{2}{3} x^{3/2}y^{1/2} \right]_{x=0}^{x=y^2} dy \\\\

  The square of the distance between the tips of the minute and hour hands on a certain clock is given by
  $$f(t) = 25 - 24 \cos (2\pi t - \frac{\pi}{6}t), \qquad (t = \text{hours since midnight})$$
  Compute $f'(1)$. Simplify your answer as much as possible.

q5_1_s: |
  $f'(t) = 24\sin(\frac{11\pi}{6} t) \cdot \frac{11\pi}{6} = 44 \pi \sin(\frac{11\pi}{6} t) \\\\
  f'(1) = 44\pi \sin(\frac{11\pi}{6})$

q5_2: |
  What is the period of $f(t)$? (In other words, find the smallest number $T > 0$ such that $f(t + T) = f(t)$ for all $t$.)

q5_2_s: |
  $f(t + T) = 25 - 24 \cos (\frac{11\pi}{6}t + \frac{11\pi}{6}T) \\\\
  f(t) = 25 - 24 \cos (\frac{11\pi}{6} t)$
  <hr class="s1" />
  They will be equal if $\frac{11\pi}{6}T = 2\pi$, or $T = \frac{12}{11}$ hours.

q5_3: |
  How many times will the minute hand and hour hand line up (so that $f(t)$ is minimized) in a typical $24$ hour span, e.g. from $9$ AM today to $9$ AM tomorrow? (Hint: you don't have to solve the optimization problem to know how much time elapses between successive minima)

q5_3_s: |
  $n = \text{# of cycles}$
  <hr class="s1" />
  $T = \text{period}$
  <hr class="s1" />
  $t = \text{time it takes to execute} \; n \; \text{cycles}$
  <hr class="s1" />
  $t = nT = 24 \; \text{hours} \implies n = \frac{24}{T} = 24 \cdot \frac{11}{12} = 22$
  <hr class="s2" />
  Note: Since $24$ is an integer multiple of $T$, the number of minima that occur in that time doesn't depend on when you start (unless you start at a minimum, e.g. midnight, and count both ends)
