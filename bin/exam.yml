  1\. Find a formula for the derivative $\frac{dy}{dx}$ in each of the following three cases:
  <hr class="s1" />
  (a) $y = \sqrt[3]{\sin(x^3)}$
  <hr class="s1" />

q1_1_s: |
  (a) By the chain rule, the derivative is $\frac{1}{3}(\sin (x^3)^{-2/3})$ times the derivative of $\sin(x^3)$. Again by the chain rule, this latter derivative is $\cos(x^3)$ times the derivative of $x^3$, which is $3x^2$. The answer is thus a product of three terms. The value of the derivative is
  $$\frac{x^2\cos(x^3)}{\sin(x^3)^{2/3}}$$
  Note that the $1/3$ at the beginning of the problem is cancelled by the $3$ at the end of the problem.

  (b) $y = \ln \left( \frac{1}{\cos x} + \frac{\sin x}{\cos x} \right)$

q1_2_s: |
  I will write $\sec x$ for $\frac{1}{\cos x}$ and $\tan x$ for $\frac{\sin x}{\cos x}$. This is not necessary to do the problem, but I'm hoping that the solution will involve less typing for me if I go that way. The derivatives of $\sec x$ and $\tan x$ are respectively $(\sec x)(\tan x)$ and $\sec^2 x$, as you can check from the quotient rule. The derivative of $\ln(\sec x + \tan x)$ is then
  $$\frac{1}{\sec x + \tan x} \cdot \frac{d}{dx}(\sec x + \tan x) = \frac{\sec^x + (\sec x)(\tan x)}{\sec x + \tan x}$$
  In this fraction, each term in the numerator is $\sec x$ times the term in the denominator that's below it. Hence the final answer is $\sec x$. (The takeaway is that if someone asks you for a function whose derivative is $\sec x$, you'll have the answer $\ln \left( \frac{1}{\cos x} + \frac{\sin x}{\cos x} \right)$ at hand.) A final note: although my answer $\sec x$ was very tidy, you can say that it results from the simplication of a more complicated expression.

  (c) $x^4 + 4y^4 = 7$

q1_3_s: |
  This was intended as an implicit differentiation problem, but you can write $y = \pm \sqrt[4]{(7 - x^4)/4}$ and do the problem without implicit differentiation. I do really insist on the $\pm$, though: the indicated fourth root is positive, by definition, but $y$ might be negative or positive. (If you graph this function, you'll get something that looks like an ellipse that's straining to become rectangular.) The derivative of $\sqrt[4]{(7 - x^4)/4}$ is
  $$\frac{1}{4}((7 - x^4)/4)^{-3/4} \cdot \frac{d}{dx}((7 - x^4)/4) = \frac{1}{4}((7 - x^4)/4)^{-3/4} \cdot (-x^3)$$
  which we can rewrite as
  $$\frac{-x^3}{4(\sqrt[4]{(7 - x^4)/4})^3}$$
  Hence the derivative of $y$ with respect to $x$ is
  $$\frac{-x^3}{4y^3}$$
  If you write $\sqrt[4]{(7 - x^4)/4}$ in place of $y$, you are getting the sign wrong half the time. If you write $\pm \sqrt[4]{(7 - x^4)/4}$ in place of $y$, you are telling the truth, but not the whole truth.
  <hr class="s2" />
  Here is how to do the same problem *with* implicit differentiation: Differentiate both sides of $x^4 + 4y^4 = 7$ with respect to $x$ to get
  $$4x^3 + 16y^3 \frac{dy}{dx} = 0$$
  Then solve for $\frac{dy}{dx}$ to obtain $\frac{dy}{dx} = -\frac{x^3}{4y^3}$. This is the same answer as by the first method, but I think that the second method is easier to carry out.

  2\. The equation $x^2 - x - 1 = 0$ has a root between $1.5$ and $2.0$. Suppose we employ Newton's method to find an approximation for the root, starting with $2$ as our first guess for the root. What will the method output as our second guess? What will the method then output as our third guess?

q2_1_s: |
  To find a solution to $f(x) = 0$ near a guess $a$, we take $a - \frac{f(a)}{f'(a)}$ as a revised guess. Since $f(x) = x^2 - x - 1, a - \frac{f(a)}{f'(a)} = \frac{a^2 + 1}{2a - 1}$. (You don't need to write down this last expression, but I found it to be helpful.) The guess $a = 2$ leads to the revised guess $5/3$. Repeating the process with $5/3$ in place of $2$, we obtain the second revised guess $34/21$ for the root. This is infact very close to the actual root: The true root $(1 + \sqrt{5})/2$ has decimal value $1.618 ...$, whereas $34/21 \approx 1.619$.

  3a\. Let
  $$f(x) = \begin{cases} x^2 \sin(1/x) & \text{if} \; x \ne 0 \\\\ 0 \; \text{if} x = 0 \end{cases}$$
  Use the definition of *derivative* to express $f'(0)$ as a limit.

q3_1_s: |
  By definition, $f'(0)$ is the limit $\lim_{x \to 0} \frac{f(x) - f(0)}{x - 0}$. In this case, $f(0)$ is $0$, and also $x - 0$ is $x$, so the limit is
  $$\lim_{x \to 0} \frac{f(x)}{x} = \lim_{x \to 0}{x \sin(1/x)}$$

q3_2: |
  b\. Decide whether or not the limit in part (a) exists; if it does, find its value.

q3_2_s: |
  The answer is that the limit does exist, and in fact the limit is $0$. The reason is that the first factor in the prodcut, namely $x$, is going to $0$, while the second factor is between $-1$ and $+1$. Hence the product is going to $0$. I don't expect people to be "proving" this rigorously, but I hope that they will provide a comprehensible explanation along these lines.

  4\. Sketch the graph of $y = \frac{x}{1 + x^2}$, taking note of such features as local maxima and minima, concavity, intercepts with the aes and behavior as $x \to + \infty$. Be sure to include the coordinates of any points where concavity changes or where the graph has a max or min.

q4_1_s: |
  Here's a crude hand-drawn sketch of the curve:
  <hr class="s2" />
  <p align="center">!!q4-1.png!!</p>
  <hr class="s2" />
  The derivative of $y$ is $\frac{1 - x^2}{(x^2 + 1)^2}$; this fraction vanishes when $x = \pm 1$; for those $x$-values there's a local min or a local max. The second derivative is $\frac{2x^3 - 6x}{(x^2 + 1)^3}$, which vanishes for $x = 0$ and for $x = \pm \sqrt{3}$. The curve is concave down from $-\infty$ to $-\sqrt{3}$, concave up from $-\sqrt{3}$ to $0$, down again from $0$ to $\sqrt{3}$ and finally concave up from $\sqrt{3}$ to $\infty$. For $x \to \infty$, $y$ is approaching $0$ from above; for $x \to -\infty$, $y$ is approaching $0$ from below.

  5\. Evaluate each of the following limits (if they exist):
  <hr class="s1" />
  (a) $\lim_{x \to 0^{+}} x^{1/x}$

q5_1_s: |
  You can just reason through the problem. When $x$ is small and positive, $1/x$ is enormous and positive. You are taking a tiny number and raising it to a huge power. The result is miniscule. This function approaches $0$. l'HÃ´pital's rule is neither needed nor relevant.

q5_2: |
  (b) $\lim_{x \to \infty} \left( \sqrt{x^2 + x + 1} - x \right)$

q5_2_s: |
  The single technique to use is to multiply and divide by $\sqrt{x^2 + x + 1} + x$:
  $$\sqrt{x^2 + x + 1} - x = \left( \sqrt{x^2 + x + 1} - x \right) \cdot \frac{\sqrt{x^2 + x + 1} + x}{\sqrt{x^2 + x + 1} + x} = \frac{x^2 + x + 1 - x^2}{\sqrt{x^2 + x + 1} + 1}$$
  Then
  $$\frac{x^2 + x + 1 - x^2}{\sqrt{x^2 + x + 1} + x} = \frac{x + 1}{\sqrt{x^2 + x + 1} + x} = \frac{1 + \frac{1}{x}}{\sqrt{1 + \frac{1}{x} + \frac{1}{x^2}} + 1}$$
  As $x \to \infty$, the quantities $\frac{1}{x}$ and $\frac{1}{x^2}$ approach $0$, so the limit is $\frac{1}{1 + 1} = \frac{1}{2}$.
