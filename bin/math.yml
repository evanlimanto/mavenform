  Let $\mathbf{v}_1 = \left[ \begin{array}{c} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ -2 \end{array} \right], \mathbf{v}_2 = \left[ \begin{array}{c} 0 \\\\ -3 \\\\ 8 \end{array} \right], \mathbf{v}_3 = \left[ \begin{array}{c} 4 \\\\ -1 \\\\ -5 \end{array} \right]$.
  <hr class="s1" />
  Does $\\{ \mathbf{v}_1, \mathbf{v}_2, \mathbf{v}_3 \\}$ span $\mathbb{R}^3$? Why or why not?

q1_22_s: |
  Let $V = [V_1 V_2 V_3] = \left[ \begin{array}{c c c} 0 & 0 & 4 \\\\ 0 & -3 & -1 \\\\ -2 & 8 & -5 \end{array} \right]$.
  <hr class="s1" />
  Now, we reduce the matrix $V$.
  <hr class="s1" />
  By interchanging $R_3$ by $R_1 \implies \left[ \begin{array}{c c c} -2 & 8 & -5 \\\\ 0 & -3 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 4 \end{array} \right]$.
  <hr class="s1" />
  The matrix $V$ has a pivot in each row, so the columns of the matrix $V$ span $\mathbb{R}^3$ since each $b$ in $\mathbb{R}^3$ is a linear combination of the columns of $V$.

  Let $\mathbf{q}_1, \mathbf{q}_2, \mathbf{q}_3$ and $\mathbf{v}$ represent vectors in $\mathbb{R}^5$, and let $x_1, x_2$ and $x_3$ denote scalars. Write the following vector equation as a matrix equation. Identify any symbols you choose to use.
  $$x_1 \mathbf{q}_1 + x_2 \mathbf{q}_2 + x_3 \mathbf{q}_3 = \mathbf{v}$$

q1_27_s: |
  Consider the vector equation
  $$x_1 \mathbf{q}_1 + x_2 \mathbf{q}_2 + x_3 \mathbf{q}_3 = \mathbf{v}$$
  Where $\mathbf{q}_1, \mathbf{q}_2, \mathbf{q}_3$ and $\mathbf{v}$ represent vectors in $\mathbb{R}^5$ and $x_1, x_3, x_3$ represent scalars.
  <hr class="s1" />
  The objective is to rewrite the vector equation as a matrix equation.
  <hr class="s1" />
  The vector equation $x_1 \mathbf{a}_1 + \cdots + x_n \mathbf{a}_n = \mathbf{b}$ can be expressed by a matrix equation as
  $$[ \mathbf{a}_1 \mathbf{a}_2 \cdots \mathbf{a}_n] \left[ \begin{array}{c} x_1 \\\\ \vdots \\\\ x_n \end{array} \right] = \mathbf{b}$$
  Where $\mathbf{a}_1, \dots, \mathbf{a}_n$ are columns of $A$ and $x_1, \dots, x_n$ are entries of $\mathbf{x}$.
  <hr class="s1" />
  So, set up the vectors $\mathbf{q}_1, \mathbf{q}_2, \mathbf{q}_3$ as the columns of a matrix, say $Q$ and place the weights $x_1, x_2, x_3$ as entries of a column vector, say $\mathbf{x}$.
  <hr class="s1" />
  Here, the matrix product of $Q$ and $\mathbf{x}$ is possible, because the number of columns $\mathbf{q}_1, \mathbf{q}_2, \mathbf{q}_3$ in $Q$ is same as the number of entries $x_1, x_2, x_3$ in $\mathbf{x}$.
  <hr class="s1" />
  Therefore, the given vector equation can be expressed by a matrix equation as
  $$[\mathbf{q}_1 \mathbf{q}_2 \mathbf{q}_3] \left[ \begin{array}{c} x_1 \\\\ x_2 \\\\ x_3 \end{array} \right] = \mathbf{v} \; \text{or} \; Q\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{v}$$

  Construct a $3 \times 3$ matrix, not in echelon form, whose columns span $\mathbb{R}^3$. Show that the matrix you construct has the desired property.

q1_29_s: |
  The columns of a matrix $A$ span $\mathbb{R}^3$ if and only if $A$ has a pivot position in each row.
  <hr class="s1" />
  So, first consider a $3 \times 3$ matrix that is in echelon form, and having $3$ pivot positions in each of its rows. Let that matrix be $B$. Now, apply a finite number of operations (at least $1$) on it, to get a matrix (say $A$), which is equivalent to $B$, but not in echelon form.
  <hr class="s1" />
  Thus, the matrix $A$ also have a pivot position in each row as it is equivalent to $B$, and $B$ has a pivot position in each of its rows.
  <hr class="s1" />
  Therefore, the required matrix is $A$, as it is a $3 \times 3$ matrix that is not in echelon form, and its columns span $\mathbb{R}^3$.
  <hr class="s2" />
  For example, consider a $3 \times 3$ matrix as $A$,
  $$A = \left[ \begin{array}{c c c} 1 & 2 & 1 \\\\ -3 & -1 & 2 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 3 \end{array} \right]$$
  To verify that the matrix $A$ has the property that the columns of $A$ span $\mathbb{R}^3$, reduce the matrix $A$ into its echelon form, $B$, by using a finite number of row operations.
  $$B = \left[ \begin{array}{c c c} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \end{array} \right]$$
  Then, it can be observed that there are $3$ pivot positions in each row of $B$. It follows that the matrix $A$ also has a pivot position in each row.
  <hr class="s1" />
  Therefore, the columns of $A$ span $\mathbb{R}^3$.

q1_31: |
  Let $A$ be a $3 \times 2$ matrix. Explain why the equation $A\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{b}$ cannot be consistent for all $\mathbf{b}$ in $\mathbb{R}^3$. Generalize your argument to the case of an arbitrary $A$ with more rows than columns.

q1_31_s: |
  Let $A$ be a $3 \times 2$ matrix.
  <hr class="s1" />
  The objective is to explain why the equation $A\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{b}$ cannot be consistent for all $\mathbf{b}$ in $\mathbb{R}^3$.
  <hr class="s1" />
  The equation $A\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{b}$ is consistent for all $\mathbf{b}$ in $\mathbb{R}^m$ if and only if $A$ has a pivot position in each row.
  <hr class="s1" />
  Here, the matrix $A$ is of $3$ rows and $2$ columns. Then, the matrix product $A \mathbf{x}$ to be defined for the number of variables (or entries in $\mathbf{x}$) is $2$.
  <hr class="s1" />
  So, there are at most $2$ pivot positions in the matrix $A$, therefore, there exist at least one row not having a pivot position.
  <hr class="s1" />
  If $A$ does not have a pivot position in at least one row, then the equation $A\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{b}$ cannot be consistent for each $\mathbf{b}$ in $\mathbb{R}^3$.
  <hr class="s1" />
  In general, if the number of rows $m$ is more than the number of columns $n$ in a matrix $A$, then the number of pivot positions is less than the number of rows. Therefore, there exists at least one row that does not contain a pivot position.
  <hr class="s1" />
  Hence, the equation $A\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{b}$ is inconsistent, for each matrix $A$ with more rows than columns.

q1_32: |
  Could a set of three vectors in $\mathbb{R}^4$ span all of $\mathbb{R}^4$? Explain. What about $n$ vectors in $\mathbb{R}^m$ when $n$ is less than $m$?

q1_32_s: |
  A set of three vectors in $\mathbb{R}^4$ represents a matrix of $3$ column vectors, and each vector contains $4$ entries (that is, a matrix of $4$ rows, and $3$ columns).
  <hr class="s1" />
  Let $A$ be that $4 \times 3$ matrix.
  <hr class="s1" />
  The columns of $A$ span $\mathbb{R}^m$ is and only if $A$ has a pivot position in each row.
  <hr class="s1" />
  So, there are at most $3$ pivot positions in the matrix $A$, but the number of rows is $4$. Therefore, there exists at least one row not having a pivot position.
  <hr class="s1" />
  If $A$ does not have a pivot position in at least one row, then the columns of $A$ do not span $\mathbb{R}^4$.
  <hr class="s1" />
  It implies that the set of $3$ vectors of $A$ does not span all of $\mathbb{R}^4$.
  <hr class="s1" />
  In general, the set of $n$ vectors in $\mathbb{R}^m$ represents a matrix of $m$ rows, and $n$ columns (an $m \times n$ matrix).
  <hr class="s1" />
  So, there are at most $n$ pivot positions in the matrix $A$, but $n$ is less than the number of rows $m$. Therefore, there exists at least one row that does not contain a pivot position.
  <hr class="s1" />
  Hence, the set of $n$ vectors of $A$ does not span all of $\mathbb{R}^m$, for $n < m$.

q1_34: |
  Suppose $A$ is a $3 \times 3$ amtrix and $\mathbf{b}$ is a vector in $\mathbb{R}^3$ with the property that $A \mathbf{x} = \mathbf{b}$ has a unique solution. Explain why the columns of $A$ must span $\mathbb{R}^3$.

q1_34_s: |
  If the equation $Ax = b$ has a unique solution, then the associated system of equations does not have any free variables. If every variable is a basic variable, then each column of $A$ is a pivot column. So the reduced echelon form of $A$ must be $\left[ \begin{array}{c c c} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \end{array} \right]$. Now it is clear that $A$ has a pivot position in each row. These statements are logically equivalent:
  - For each bin $\mathbb{R}^n$ the equation $Ax = b$ has a solution.
  - Each $b$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$ is a linear combination of the columns of $A$.
  - The columns of $A$ span $\mathbb{R}^n$.
  - $A$ has a pivot position in every row.

q1_35: |
  Let $A$ be a $3 \times 4$ matrix, let $\mathbf{y}_1$ and $\mathbf{y}_2$ be vectors in $\mathbb{R}^3$ and let $\mathbf{w} = \mathbf{y}_1 + \mathbf{y}_2$. Suppose $\mathbf{y}_1 = A\mathbf{x}_1$ and $\mathbf{y}_2 = A\mathbf{x}_2$ for some vectors $\mathbf{x}_1$ and $\mathbf{x}_2$ in $\mathbb{R}^4$. What fact allows you to conlude that the system $A\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{w}$ is consistent? (Note: $\mathbf{x}_1$ and $\mathbf{x}_2$ denote vectors, not scalar entries in vectors.)

q1_35_s: |
  Given $Ax_1 = y_1$ and $Ax_2 = y_2$, you are asked to show that the equation $Ax = w$ has a solution, where $w = y_1 + y_2$. Observe that $w = Ax_1 + Ax_2$. Now by the theorem, if $A$ is an $m \times n$ matrix, $u, v$ are vectors in $\mathbb{R}^n$, and $c$ is a scalar, then
  $$A(U + V) = AU + AV$$
  Replace $x_1$ and $x_2$ in place of $u$ and $v$. That is, $w = Ax_1 + Ax_2 = A(x_1 + x_2)$. So the vector $x = x_1 + x_2$ is a solution of $w = Ax$.
