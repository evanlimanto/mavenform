  $$(-21, 23) - (a, 6) = (-25, b)$$

  $$a = 4, b = 17$$

q1_13: |
  Use set theoretic or vector notation or both to describe the points that lie in the plane spanned by $v_1 = (2, 7, 0)$ and $v_2 = (0, 2, 7)$.

q1_13_s: |
  Let any point in the plane be $\vec{r} = (x, y, z)$.
  Then $\vec{r}$ will be of the form $\vec{r} = s\vec{v_1} + t\vec{v_2}$,
  where $s, t \in \mathbb{R}$
  <hr class="s1" />
  $\implies \vec{r} = s(2, 7, 0) + t(0, 2, 7) \\\\
  \implies (x, y, z) = (2s, 7s + 2t, 7t)$
  <hr class="s2" />
  Any point in the plane spanned by the given vectors is $\vec{r} = (2s, 7s + 2t, 7t)$.

q1_15: |
  Use set theoretic or vector notation or both to describe the points that lie in the line passing through $(-1, -1, -1)$ in the direction of $\mathbf{j}$.

q1_15_s: |
  Let a general point on the line be $\vec{r} = (x, y, z)$.
  <hr class="s1" />
  We have a formula that is the equation of the line $l$ through the tip of $\mathbf{a}$ and passing in the direction of the vector $\mathbf{v}$ is $l(t) = \mathbf{a} + t\mathbf{v}$ where the parameter $t$ takes on all real values.
  <hr class="s1" />
  In coordinate form the equations are
  $$x = x_1 + at \\\\
  y = y_1 + bt \\\\
  z = z_1 + ct$$
  Where $\mathbf{a} = (x_1, y_1, z_1)$ and $v = (a, b, c)$.
  <hr class="s1" />
  Here $(x_1, y_1, z_1) = (-1, -1, -1)$ and $v = (0, 1, 0)$.
  <hr class="s1" />
  Computing $\vec{r} = (x, y, z)$
  $$x = (-1) + 0(t) = -1 \\\\
  y = (-1) + 1(t) = -1 + t \\\\
  z = (-1) + 0(t) = -1$$
  Therefore, $\vec{r} = (-1, -1 + t, -1)$.

q1_17: |
  Use set theoretic or vector notation or both to describe the points that lie in the line passing through $(-1, -1, -1)$ and $(1, -1, 2)$.

q1_17_s: |
  Let given points be $P = (-1, -1, -1)$ and $Q = (1, -1, 2)$.
  Now we have to describe the points that lie in the given configuration.
  <hr class="s1" />
  The parametric equations of the line $l$ through the points $(x_1, y_1, z_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2, z_2)$ are $$x = x_1 + (x_2 - x_1)t \\\\ y = y_1 + (y_2 - y_1)t \\\\ z = z_1 + (z_2 - z_1)t$$
  Where $(x, y, z)$ is the general point of $l$ and the parameter $t$ takes on all real values.
  <hr class="s1" />
  The parametric equations of the line through the points $P$ and $Q$ is
  $$x = -1 + 2t \\\\
  y = -1 \\\\
  z = -1 + 3t$$
  Any point on the line passing through the given items is $(x, y, z) = (-1 + 2t, -1, -1 + 3t)$ and hence the points lie in the given configuration.
