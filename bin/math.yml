q1_1: |
  A tank initially contains $120$ liters of pure water. A mixture containing a concentration of
  $\gamma$ g/liter of salt enters the tank at a rate of $2$ liters/min, and the well-stirred mixture
  leaves the tank at the same rate. Find an expression in terms of $\gamma$ for the amount of salt in the
  tank at any time $t$. Also find the limiting amount of salt in the tank as $t \to \infty$.

q1_1_s: |
  Assume that the amount of salt in the tank at time $t$ is $Q(t)$. Then the rate of
  change of salt is given by $\frac{dQ(t)}{dt}$.
  <hr class="s1" />
  But $\frac{dQ}{dt}$ = rate of mixture flowing in the tank - rate of mixture flowing
  out of the tank. i.e. $\frac{dQ}{dt}$ = rate in $-$ rate out.
  <hr class="s1" />
  Now rate in = $2l / \; \text{min} \times \gamma \; \text{g/l} = 2\gamma \text{g/min}$.
  <hr class="s1" />
  Rate out = $2l / \text{min} \times \frac{Q}{120} \text{g/l} = \frac{1}{60} Q \; \text{g/min}$
  $$\frac{dQ}{dt} = 2\gamma - \frac{1}{60}Q - - - - (1) \\\\
  \frac{dQ}{dt} = \frac{120\gamma - Q}{60} \\\\
  \frac{dQ}{dt} = -\frac{(Q - 120\gamma)}{60} \\\\
  \frac{dQ}{Q - 120\gamma} = \frac{-1}{60} dt$$
  Integrating both sides
  $$\int \frac{dQ}{Q - 120\gamma} = \int \frac{-1}{60} dt$$
  $$\ln |Q - 120\gamma | = \frac{-t}{60} + p$$
  where $p$ is an arbitrary constant of integration.
  $$Q - 120 \gamma = e^{-t/60} \cdot e^{p}$$
  Let $e^p = c$, another arbitrary constant.
  $$Q = 120 \gamma + ce^{-t/60}$$
  Initially when $t = 0, Q = 0$
  $$0 = 120 \gamma + c \\\\
  c = -120\gamma$$
  Then $Q = 120 \gamma - 120\gamma e^{-t/60}$
  $$Q = 120 \gamma \left( 1 - e^{-t/60} \right)$$
  which is the required expression for the amount of salt in the tank at time $t$.
  To find the limiting amount of salt in tank, as $t \to \infty$, set $\frac{dQ}{dt} = 0$ in equation $(1)$.
  $$2\gamma - \frac{1}{60}Q = 0 \\\\
  \frac{-Q}{60} = -2\gamma \\\\
  Q = 120 \gamma$$
  The limiting value is $Q = 120 \gamma$.

  A certain college graduate borrow \$ $8000$ to buy a car. The lender charges interest at
  an annual rate of $10$%. Assuming that interest is compounded continuously and that the borrowser
  makes payments continuously at a constant annual rate $k$, determine the payment rate $k$
  that is required to pay off the loan in $3$ years. Also determine how much interest is paid
  during the $3$-year period.

q1_2_s: |
  Assume that $S(t)$ is the investment at any time $t$. Then the rate of change of the investment
  $\frac{dS}{dt}$ is equal to the interest rate $r$ times the current value of the investment i.e.
  $\frac{dS}{dt} = rS$.
