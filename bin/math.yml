  Find a general solution to the given differential equation.
  $$y'' + 6y' + 9y = 0$$

q1_1_s: |
  Auxiliary equation is $r^2 + 6r + 9 = 0 \implies (r + 3)^2 = 0 \implies r = -3, -3$ are repeated roots.
  <hr class="s1" />
  So, $e^{-3t}, te^{-3t}$ are two linearly independent solutions. Hence the solution is $y = c_1e^{-3t} + c_2te^{-3t}$.

q1_3: |
  Find a general solution to the given differential equation.
  $$y'' - y' - 2y = 0$$

q1_3_s: |
  Auxiliary equation is $r^2 - r - 2 = 0 \implies (r - 2)(r + 1) = 0 \implies r = 2, -1$.
  <hr class="s1" />
  So $e^{2t}, e^{-t}$ are two linearly independent solutions. Hence the solution is $y = c_1e^{2t} + c_2e^{-t}$.

q1_13: |
  Solve the given initial value problem.
  $$y'' + 2y' - 8y = 0; \; y(0) = 3, y'(0) = -12$$

q1_13_s: |
  Auxiliary equation is $r^2 + 2r - 8 = 0 \implies r = 2, -4$. So $e^{2t}, e^{-4t}$ are the two linearly independent solutions. Hence the solution is $y = c_1e^{2t} + c_2^{-4t}$.
  $$y' = 2c_1e^{2t} - 4c_2e^{-4t} \\\\
  y'' = 4c_1e^{2t} + 16c_2e^{-4t} \\\\
  y(0) = c_1e^{2 \times 0} + c_2e^{-4 \times 0} = c_1 + c_2 = 3$$
  And $y'(0) = 2c_1 - 4c_2 = -12 \implies c_1 - 2c_2 = -6$.
  $$\begin{cases} c_1 + c_2 &= 3 \\\\ c_1 - 2c_2 &= -6 \end{cases}$$
  Solving, we get $c_1 = 0, c_2 = 3. Hence the solution is $y = 3e^{-4t}$.

q1_15: |
  Solve the given initial value problem.
  $$y'' + y' = 0; \; y(0) = 2, y'(0) = 1$$

q1_15_s: |
  Auxiliary equation is $r^2 - 4r - 5 = 0 \implies r = 5, -1$. So, $e^{5t}, e^{-t}$ are the linearly independent solutions. Hence, the solution is $y = c_1e^{5t} + c_2e^{-t}$.
  $$y' = 5c_1e^{5t} - c_2e^{-t} \\\\
  y(-1) = c_1e^{-5} + c_2e = 3 \\\\
  y'(-1) = 5c_1e^{-5} - c_2e = 9 \\\\
  \implies c_2 = 3 - c_1e^{-5} \\\\
  \implies c_2 = 3e^{-1} - c_1e^{-6}$$
  Then, $5c_1e^{-5} = 9 + c_2e = 12 - c_1e^{-5} \implies 6c_1e^{-5} = 12 \implies c_1 = 2e^5, c_2 = e^{-1}$. Hence, the solution is $y = 2e^{5(1+t)} + e^{-(t+1)}$.

  (a) Substituting $y = e^{rt}$, find the auxiliary equation for the first-order linear equation $ay' + by = 0$, where $a$ and $b4 are constants with $a \ne 0$.
  <hr class="s1" />
  (b) Use the result of part (a) to find the general solution.

q1_21_s: |
  (a) We have $a \times re^{rt} + be^{rt} = 0 \implies (ar + b)e^{rt} = 0$. So, $ar + b = 0$ is the auxiliary equation.
  <hr class="s1" />
  (b) Then, we have $ar + b = 0 \implies r = \frac{-b}{a}$. So, $e^{\frac{-b}{at}}$ is the solution. So, $y = ce^{\frac{-bt}{a}}$ is the general solution of the given equation, $c =$ constant.

q1_27: |
  Determine whether the functions $y_1$ and $y_2$ are linearly dependent on the interval $(0, 1)$.
  $$y_1(t) = \cos t \sin t, y_2(t) = \sin 2t$$

q1_27_s: |
  $$y_1(t) = \cos t \sin t \\\\
  y_2(t) = \sin 2t = 2\sin t \cos t$$
  So, $y_2(t) = 2y_1(t)$. Hence $y_1(t)$ and $y_2(t)$ are linearly dependent.

q1_37: |
  Find three linearly independent solutions of the given third-order differential equation and write a general solution as an arbitrary linear combination of these.
  $$y''' + y'' - 6y' + 4y = 0$$

q1_37_s: |
  Auxiliary equation is $r^3 + r^2 - 6r + 4 = 0 \implies r = -1, -1 \pm \sqrt{5}$.
  <hr class="s1" />
  So, the three roots are $r = 1, \sqrt{5} - 1, -\sqrt{5} - 1$.
  <hr class="s1" />
  So, $e^{t}, e^{t(\sqrt{5} - 1)}, e^{-(\sqrt{5} + 1)t}$ are three linearly independent solutions. Hence, the solution is $y = c_1e^t + c_2e^{(\sqrt{5} - 1)t} + c_3e^{-(1 + \sqrt{5})t}$.
