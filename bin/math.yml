  $\begin{align}
  v &= \int_0^1 (y^4 - y^8) dy \\\\
  &= \int_0^1 \pi (y^4 - y^8) dy \\\\
  &= \int_0^1 (\pi y^4 - \pi y^8) dy \\\\
  &= \int_0^1 (\pi(y^2)^2 - \pi(y^4)^2) dy

  <hr class="s1" />
  The volume of the solid $v = \int_0^1 A(y) dy$.
  <hr class="s1" />
  The cross-sectional area of the washer $A(y) = \pi (\text{outer radius})^2 - \pi(\text{inner radius})^2$.
  <hr class="s1" />
  The washer has an outer radius of $y^2$ and an inner radius of $y^4$.
  <hr class="s1" />
  The solid is obtained by rotating the region bounded by curves $x = y^2$ and $x = y^4$ from $y = 0$ to $y = 1$ about the $y$-axis, or $y^4 \le x \le y^2, 0 \le y \le 1$ about the $y$-axis.

q47_1_s: |
  Let the vertex of the cone be at the origin and let $A$ be the center of the base of the cone located on the $x$-axis. The base radius is $r$ and the height of the cone is $h$.
  <hr class="s1" />
  Let $B$ be any point on the base of the cone, where $AB = r$ and $OA = h$ (where $O$ is the origin).

  <hr class="s1" />
  The slope of the line $OB = \frac{r}{h}$.
  <hr class="s1" />
  The equation of the line $OB \implies y = \frac{r}{h} x$.
  <hr class="s1" />
  Rotate the region $OAB$ about the $x$-axis to produce a right circular cone of radius $r$ and height $h$. Choose a typical disk at any point.
  <hr class="s1" />
  The cross-sectional area of the typical disk
  $A(x) = \pi (\text{radius})^2 = \pi \left( \frac{r}{h} x \right)^2 = \frac{\pi r^2}{h^2} x^2$
  <hr class="s1" />
  The volume of the cone obtained by rotating $OAB$ about the $x$-axis $V = \int_0^h A(x) dx = \int_0^h \pi \frac{r^2}{h^2} x^2 dx = \frac{1}{3} \pi r^2h$

  Find the volume of the solid: The base of $S$ is an elliptical region with boundary curve $9x^2 + 4y^2 = 36$. Cross-sections perpendicular to the $x$-axis are isosceles right triangles with hypotenuse in the base.

q55_1_s: |
  The base of the solid is an elliptical region $R$ with a boundary curve, $9x^2 + 4y^2 = 36$, is shown below. The cross sections are isosceles right triangles, which are perpendicular to the $x$-axis. The hypotenuse of the triangle is in the base. In the following figure, $BC$ is the hypotenuse of the isosceles right triangles.
  <hr class="s1" />
  <p align="center">!!q55-1.png!!</p>
  <hr class="s1" />
  Consider the equation $9x^2 + 4y^2 = 36$.
  <hr class="s1" />
  $\begin{align}
  9x^2 + 4y^2 &= 36 \\\\
  4y^2 &= 36 - 9x^2 \\\\
  y^2 &= \frac{36 - 9x^2}{4} \\\\
  y &= \frac{3}{2} \sqrt{4 - x^2}
  \end{align}$
  <hr class="s2" />
  Calculate the length of the hypotenuse $BC$.
  <hr class="s1" />
  $\begin{align}
  L &= 2y \\\\
  &= 2 \left( \frac{3}{2} \sqrt{4 - x^2} \right) \\\\
  &= 3 \sqrt{4 - x^2}
  \end{align}$
  <hr class="s1" />
  Calculate the area of the isosceles right triangle in terms of hypotenuse.
  <hr class="s1" />
  $\begin{align}
  A &= \frac{L^2}{4} \\\\
  &= \frac{\left( 3 \sqrt{4 - x^2} \right)^2}{4} \\\\
  &= \frac{9(4 - x^2)}{4}
  \end{align}$
  <hr class="s1" />
  Therefore, the cross sectional area is $A(x) = \frac{9(4 - x^2)}{4}$.
  <hr class="s1" />
  And the $x$ varies from $-2$ to $2$.
  <hr class="s1" />
  Calculate the volume of the solid as follows.
  <hr class="s1" />
  $\begin{align}
  V &= \int_{-2}^{2} A(x) dx \\\\
  &= \int_{-2}^{2} \frac{9(4 - x^2)}{4} dx \\\\
  &= \frac{9}{4} \int_{-2}^{2} (4 - x^2) dx \\\\
  &= 24
  \end{align}$

  (a) Set up an integral for the volume of a solid *torus* (the donut-shaped solid shown in the figure) with radii $r$ and $R$.
  <hr class="s1" />
  (b) By interpreting the integral as an area, find the volume of the torus.

q61_1_s: |
  (a) The sketch of the solid torus is shown below.
  <hr class="s1" />
  <p align="center">!!q61-1.png!!</p>
  <hr class="s1" />
  The cross-section of the torus is shown below.

  <hr class="s1" />
  Consider a circle with radius $r$ whose center is at the distance $R$ from the origin on the $x$-axis. If we rotate this circle about the $y$-axis then we get a torus with radii $r$ and $R$.
  <hr class="s1" />
  Then the equation of the circle is $(x - R)^2 + y^2 = r^2$.
  <hr class="s1" />
  Then the equation of the right half of the circle is $x = R + \sqrt{r^2 - y^2}$ and the equation of the left half of the circle is $x = R - \sqrt{r^2 - y^2}$.
  <hr class="s2" />
  Then the volume of the torus is
  <hr class="s1" />
  $V = \pi \int_{-r}^{r} \left[ \left( R + \sqrt{r^2 - y^2} \right)^2 - \left( R - \sqrt{r^2 - y^2} \right)^2 \right] dy$
  <hr class="s1" />
  Since it is an even function, symmetrical above and below the $x$-axis, you only need to take the limit above the $x$ axis and multiply by $2$.
  <hr class="s1" />
  $V = 2\pi \int_0^r \left[ \left( R^2 + r^2 - y^2 + 2R \sqrt{r^2 - y^2} \right) - \left( R^2 + r^2 - y^2 - 2R \sqrt{r^2 - y^2} \right) \right] dy \\\\
  V = 8\pi R \int_0^r \sqrt{r^2 - y^2} dy$
  <hr class="s2" />
  (b) Recall the integral formula:
  <hr class="s1" />
  $\int \sqrt{a^2 - x^2} dx = \frac{1}{2} \left( x \sqrt{a^2 - x^2} + a^2 \tan^{-1} \left( \frac{y}{\sqrt{a^2 - x^2}} \right) \right) + \text{constant}$
  So
  <hr class="s1" />
  $\begin{align}
  V &= 8\pi R \int_0^r \sqrt{r^2 - y^2} dy \\\\
  &= 8 \pi R \left[ \frac{1}{2} \left( y\sqrt{r^2 - y^2} + r^2 \tan^{-1} \left( \frac{y}{\sqrt{r^2 - y^2}} \right) \right) \right]_0^r \\\\
  &= 8 \pi R \cdot \left[ \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{r^2 \pi}{2} \right) \right] \\\\
  &= 2\pi^2 r^2R
  \end{align}$

  The center of each sphere lies on the surface of the other sphere, and the distance between their centers is $r$.
  <hr class="s2" />
  Consider two circles with radius $r$ that the center of each circle lies on the other circle. Join the points of intersection of the circles so that this line bisects the line joining the centers of the circles.
  <hr class="s2" />
  Let the points of intersection lie on the $y$-axis and let the centers of the circles lie on the $x$-axis. The shaded region bounded by these circles is symmetric about both the $x$-axis and the $y$-axis. Consider the volume of the solid obtained by rotating about the $x$-axis just the part of the shaded region that lies in the first quadrant. This is half of the volume of the common region of the two spheres.
  <hr class="s2" />
  The center of the left circle is at the point $(-r/2, 0)$ and the radius of the circle is $r$.
  <hr class="s1" />
  The equation of the circle $(x + r/2)^2 + y^2 = r^2, y = \sqrt{r^2 - (x + r/2)^2}$.
  <hr class="s2" />
  The volume of the solid obtained by rotating about the $x$-axis in this part of the region (which lies in the first quadrant)
  <hr class="s1" />
  $v_1 = \int_0^{r / 2} \pi ( \sqrt{r^2 - (x + r/2)^2})^2 dx \\\\
  v_1 = \pi \int_0^{r/2} (r^2 - (x + r/2)^2) dx \\\\
  v_1 = \frac{5\pi r^3}{24}$
  <hr class="s2" />
  The total volume of the region common to the two spheres $V = 2v_1 = \frac{5 \pi r^3}{12}$.
