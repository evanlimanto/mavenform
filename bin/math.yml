  Describe the possible echelon forms of the matrix.
  <hr class="s1" />
  $A$ is a $3 \times 3$ matrix with linearly independent columns.

q1_23_s: |
  The objective is to illustrate the possible echelon forms of a $3 \times 3$ matrix with linearly independent columns, by using the symbols $@, *$ and $0$.
  <hr class="s1" />
  Here, the leading entry $@$ may have any nonzero value, the starred entry $*$ may have any value (can be zero also), and the symbol $0$ represents zero.
  <hr class="s1" />
  Any $3 \times 3$ matrix can have $3, 2, 1$ or $0$ pivot columns.
  <hr class="s1" />
  The column which has the pivot position (the location of the leading entry) is said to be a pivot column.
  <hr class="s1" />
  However, it is given that the columns of $A$ are linearly independent.
  <hr class="s1" />
  The columns of $A$ are linearly independent, only if all the columns are pivot columns.
  <hr class="s1" />
  So, the $3 \times 3$ matrix must have $3$ pivot columns.
  <hr class="s1" />
  Therefore, the only possible echelon form for a $3 \times 3$ matrix with linearly independent columns is
  $$\left[ \begin{array}{c c c} @ & * & * \\\\ 0 & @ & * \\\\ 0 & 0 & @ \end{array} \right]$$

  Describe the possible echelon forms of the matrix.
  <hr class="s1" />
  $A$ is a $4 \times 3$ matrix, $A = [\mathbf{a}_1 \; \mathbf{a}_2 \; \mathbf{a}_3]$, such that $\\{ \mathbf{a}_1, \mathbf{a}_2 \\}$ is linearly independent and $\mathbf{a}_3$ is not in $\text{Span} \\{ \mathbf{a}_1, \mathbf{a}_2 \\}$.

q1_26_s: |
  Suppose that $A$ is a $4 \times 3$ matrix such that the set $\\{ \mathbf{a}_1, \mathbf{a}_2 \\}$ is linearly independent, and the remaining vector $\mathbf{a}_3$ is not in $\text{span} \\{ \mathbf{a}_1, \mathbf{a}_2 \\}$.
  <hr class="s1" />
  This implies that the set $\\{ \mathbf{a}_1, \mathbf{a}_2, \mathbf{a}_3 \\}$ is linearly independent.
  <hr class="s1" />
  So, the columns of the matrix $A = [ \mathbf{a}_1 \mathbf{a}_2 \mathbf{a}_3 ]$ are linearly independent.
  <hr class="s1" />
  As there are $3$ vectors in a $4 \times 3$ matrix, it can have $3, 2, 1$, or $0$ pivot columns.
  <hr class="s1" />
  The columns of $A$ are linearly independent, only if all the columns are pivot columns. So, the $4 \times 3$ matrix must have $3$ pivot columns.
  <hr class="s1" />
  Therefore, the only possible echelon form for a $4 \times 3$ matrix with the given property is
  $$\left[ \begin{array}{c c c} @ & * & * \\\\ 0 & @ & * \\\\ 0 & 0 & @ \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \end{array} \right]$$

q1_36: |
  The following is either true or false. If false, construct a specific example to show that the statement is no t always true.
  <hr class="s1" />
  If $\mathbf{v}_1, \dots , \mathbf{v}_4$ are in $\mathbb{R}^4$ and $\mathbf{v}_3$ is *not* a linear combination of $\mathbf{v}_1, \mathbf{v}_2, \mathbf{v}_4$ then $\\{ \mathbf{v}_1, \mathbf{v}_2, \mathbf{v}_3, \mathbf{v}_4 \\}$ is also linearly dependent.

q1_36_s: |
  Counterexample: Let us consider $v_1, v_2$ and $v_4$ all to be multiples of one vector. Let $v_3$ be a non-multiple of that vector.
  $$v_1 = \left[ \begin{array}{c} 1 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 1 \end{array} \right],
  v_2 = \left[ \begin{array}{c} 2 \\\\ 2 \\\\ 2 \\\\ 2 \end{array} \right],
  v_3 = \left[ \begin{array}{c} 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \end{array} \right],
  v_4 = \left[ \begin{array}{c} 4 \\\\ 4 \\\\ 4 \\\\ 4 \end{array} \right]$$
  It is clear that $v_4 = 2v_1 + v_2$ i.e. $v_4$ is expressed as a linear combination of $v_1$ and $v_2$. So the vectors $v_1, v_2, v_4$ are linearly dependent. Since $\\{ v_1, v_2, v_3, v_4 \\}$ is the superset of linearly dependent vectors $\\{ v_1, v_2, v_4 \\}$ and we know that the superset of a set of linearly dependent vectors is also linearly dependent, the set $\\{ v_1, v_2, v_3, v_4 \\}$ is linearly dependent. Hence the given statement is false.

q1_37: |
  The following is either true or false. If false, construct a specific example to show that the statement is not always true.
  <hr class="s1" />
  If $\mathbf{v}_1, \dots , \mathbf{v}_4$ are in $\mathbb{R}^4$ and $\\{ \mathbf{v}_1, \mathbf{v}_2, \mathbf{v}_3 \\}$ is linearly dependent, then $\\{ \mathbf{v}_1, \mathbf{v}_2, \mathbf{v}_3, \mathbf{v}_4 \\}$ is also linearly dependent.

q1_37_s: |
  Consider a set of vectors $\\{ \mathbf{v}_1, \mathbf{v}_2, \mathbf{v}_3, \mathbf{v}_4 \\}$ in $\mathbb{R}^4$ such that the set $\\{ \mathbf{v}_1, \mathbf{v}_2, \mathbf{v}_3 \\}$ is linearly dependent.
  <hr class="s1" />
  A set of vectors $\\{ \mathbf{v}_1, \mathbf{v}_2, \dots, \mathbf{v}_p \\}$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$ is said to be linearly dependent if the following conditions hold:
  $$x_1\mathbf{v}_1 + x_2\mathbf{v}_2 + \dots + x_p\mathbf{v}_p = \mathbf{0} \; \text{and not all} \; x_1, x_2, \dots , x_p \; \text{are zero}$$
  So, the set $\\{ \mathbf{v}_1, \mathbf{v}_2, \mathbf{v}_3 \\}$ is linearly dependent implies
  $$x_1\mathbf{v}_1 + x_2\mathbf{v}_2 + x_3\mathbf{v}_3 = \mathbf{0} \; \text{and not all the scalars} \; x_1, x_2, x_3 \; \text{are zero}$$
  The equation $x_1 \mathbf{v}_1 + x_2 \mathbf{v}_2 + x_3 \mathbf{v}_3 = \mathbf{0}$ can be written as
  $$x_1 \mathbf{v}_1 + x_2 \mathbf{v}_2 + x_3 \mathbf{v}_3 + 0 \cdot \mathbf{v}_4 = \mathbf{0}$$
  By the previous condition, the scalars $x_1, x_2, x_3$ are not all zero.
  <hr class="s1" />
  Thus, the set $\\{ \mathbf{v}_1, \mathbf{v}_2, \mathbf{v}_3, \mathbf{v}_4 \\}$ is linearly dependent. Therefore, the statement is **true.**

q1_38: |
  If $\mathbf{v}_1, \dots \mathbf{v}_4$ are linearly independent vectors in $\mathbb{R}^4$, then $\\{ \mathbf{v}_1, \mathbf{v}_2, \mathbf{v}_3 \\}$ is also linearly independent. [Hint: Think about $x_1 \mathbf{v}_1  + x_2 \mathbf{v}_2 + x_3 \mathbf{v}_3 + 0 \cdot \mathbf{v}_4 = \mathbf{0}$.]

q1_40: |
  Suppose an $m \times n$ matrix $A$ has $n$ pivot columns. Explain why for each $\mathbf{b}$ in $\mathbb{R}^m$ the equation $A \mathbf{x} = \mathbf{b}$ has at most one solution. [Hint: Explain why $A \mathbf{x} = \mathbf{b}$ cannot have infinitely many solutions.]

q1_40_s: |
  Suppose that $A$ is an $m \times n$ matrix such that $A$ has $n$ pivot columns.
  <hr class="s1" />
  As the number of columns in $A$ is $n$, and $A$ has $n$ pivot columns, each column in $A$ is a pivot column.
  <hr class="s1" />
  So, all the variables in the coefficient matrix of $A\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{b}$ are basic, and there is no chance for existing free variables.
  <hr class="s1" />
  A system can have a unique solution only if it has no free variables by the Existence and Uniqueness Theorem.
  <hr class="s1" />
  Therefore, if the system $A\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{b}$ is consistent, then it has a unique solution only.
  <hr class="s1" />
  Hence, the system $A\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{b}$ has at most one solution, if $A$ has $n$ pivot columns.
