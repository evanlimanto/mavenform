  Suppose the solution set of a certain system of linear equations can be described as $x_1 = 5 + 4x_3, x_2 = -2 - 7x_3$, with $x_3$ free. Use vectors to describe this set as a line in $\mathbb{R}^3$.

q1_13_s: |
  The solution set of a system of linear equations is given as
  $$x_1 = 5 + 4x_3 \\\\
  x_2 = -2 - 7x_3 \\\\
  x_3 \; \text{is free}$$
  The objective is to describe this set as a line in $\mathbb{R}^3$.

  Rewrite the given solution set in parametric vector form as follows:
  $$\mathbf{x} = \left[ \begin{array}{c} x_1 \\\\ x_2 \\\\ x_3 \end{array} \right] = \left[ \begin{array}{c} 5 + 4x_3 \\\\ -2 -7x_3 \\\\ x_3 \end{array} \right] = \left[ \begin{array}{c} 5 \\\\ -2 \\\\ 0 \end{array} \right] + x_3 \cdot \left[ \begin{array}{c} 4 \\\\ -7 \\\\ 1 \end{array} \right]$$

  Suppose $A\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{b}$ has a solution. Explain why the solution is unique precisely when $A\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{0}$ has only the trivial solution.

q1_26_s: |
  Consider the equation $A \mathbf{x} = \mathbf{b}$. Suppose that this equation has a solution. Since this is a nonhomogeneous equation, its solution set is obtained by the translation of the solution of $A\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{0}$.
  <hr class="s1" />
  Now when $A \mathbf{x} = \mathbf{0}$ has only the trivial solution then the solution set of $A\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{b}$ also has only one vector as its solution.
  <Hr class="s1" />
  Therefore, this will happen only if $A\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{0}$ only has a trivial solution.

q1_27: |
  Suppose $A$ is the $3 \times 3$ *zero* matrix (with all zero entries). Describe the solution set of the equation $A\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{0}$.

q1_27_s: |
  Consider the matrix $A$ as a $3 \times 3$ zero matrix.
  <hr class="s1" />
  Now, we find the solution set of the equation $A\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{0}$.
  <hr class="s1" />
  Let $\mathbf{x} = \left[ \begin{array}{c} x_1 \\\\ x_2 \\\\ x_3 \end{array} \right] \in \mathbb{R}^3$. Now, we write:
  $$\begin{align}
  A\mathbf{x} &= \left[ \begin{array}{c c c} 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \end{array} \right] \left[ \begin{array}{c} x_1 \\\\ x_2 \\\\ x_3 \end{array} \right] \\\\
  &= \left[ \begin{array}{c} 0 + 0 + 0 \\\\ 0 + 0 + 0 \\\\ 0 + 0 + 0 \end{array} \right] \\\\
  &= \left[ \begin{array}{c} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \end{array} \right] = \mathbf{0}
  \end{align}$$
  Observe that every $\mathbf{x}$ in $\mathbb{R}^3$ satisfies $A\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{0}$. Therefore, the solution set is all vectors in $\mathbb{R}^3$.

q1_28: |
  If $\mathbf{b} \ne \mathbf{0}$, can the solution set of $A\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{0}$ be a plane through the origin? Explain.

q1_28_s: |
  The equation of the plane is $A\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{b}$. If the plane passes through the origin, $\mathbf{b} = A \times \mathbf{0} = \mathbf{0}$. This is a contradiction. Therefore, the solution set of $A\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{b}$ does not pass through the origin if $\mathbf{b} \ne \mathbf{0}$.

q1_38: |
  Suppose $A$ is a $3 \times 3$ matrix and $\mathbf{y}$ is a vector in $\mathbb{R}^3$ such that the equation $A\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{y}$ does *not* have a solution. Does there exist a vector $\mathbf{z}$ in $\mathbb{R}^3$ such that the equation $A\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{z}$ has a unique solution? Discuss.

q1_38_s: |
  Consider $A$ as a $3 \times 3$ matrix, and $\mathbf{b}$ a vector in $\mathbb{R}^3$ such that the equation $A \mathbf{x} = \mathbf{b}$ does not have a solution.
  <hr class="s1" />
  The objective is to say that there does exist a vector $\mathbf{y}$ in $\mathbb{R}^3$ such that the equation $A\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{y}$ has a unique solution.
  <hr class="s1" />
  The answer is **No.** If an equation $A\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{b}$ does not have a solution, then the row-reduced echelon form of a coefficient matrix $A$ has a zero row. This is because the row-reduced augmented matrix must have a row of the form $[ 0 0 0 | 1 ]$.
  <hr class="s1" />
  Now, if $A\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{y}$ has a unique solution, this means that the row-reduced form of matrix $A$ does not have any free columns, because otherwise the system $[A \mathbf{y}]$ would have free variables. This is a contradiction, because we already decided that the matrix $A$ must have a free column. Hence, there is no vector $\mathbf{y}$ in $\mathbb{R}^3$ such that the equation $A\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{y}$ has a unique solution.
